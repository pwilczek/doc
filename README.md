# Problem
We'd like to model __Deck of Cards__ in our app and prepare __shuffled set of cards__ for a play.
So:
* cards are shuffled (random order)
* cards are ordered _1, 2, 3_
* we can get a card by its position (we get random one)
* all 52 cards (no more, no less) are in a pile after shuffling

## Standard deck of cards
_The standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards is the most common pack..._ [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck)
